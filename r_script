# Set our_data_year to whatever the year of the appropriate Census release that you want to pull from tidycensus.

# Set this to whatever Census product we want to pull data from with tidycensus. I often use acs5, for the 5-year averages of the American Community Survey, because I live and work in Georgia (the U.S. state, not the country), and I'm often asked by colleagues to pull data concerning towns with populations lower than the 60,000-person threshold for the 1-year ACS. But you can choose. To see all the options on this, check the tidycensus documentation at https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#working-with-acs-data-1.

# Let's save as a variable the number of the table we're going to be pulling from the ACS. Table B05006 is "Place of birth for the foreign-born population in the United States." The variable for people born in Ukraine is going to be B05006_044. But we just need the table number for now.
